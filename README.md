Projects I've worked on

Most of the projects mentioned in my resume are under NDA and cannot be added to my portfolio. Currently this list only contains a very early backend for the parking vignette app with partial functionality, a partially developed card battler videogame (basic actors, a card deck shuffler, bare-bones actions and modifiers for actors like debuffs and the like and the logic to apply them), alongside a couple of basic foundational projects.
